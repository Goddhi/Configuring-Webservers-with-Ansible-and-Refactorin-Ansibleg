## BEGIN ANSIBLE DEVELOPMENT


### Step 1 -  Create a directory called **ansible-config-mgt**

- Within **ansible-config-mgt** directory create a directory and name it **playbooks** – it - will be used to store all your playbook files.
- Create a directory and name it **inventory** – it will be used to keep your hosts organised.
- Within the playbooks folder, create your first playbook, and name it **common.yml**
- Within the inventory folder, create an inventory file (.yml) for each environment (Development, Staging Testing and Production) for example : dev.yml, staging.yl, uat.yml, and prod.yml respectively.

### Step 2 – Set up an Ansible Inventory

An Ansible inventory file defines the hosts and groups of hosts upon which commands, modules, and tasks in a playbook operate. Since our intention is to execute Linux commands on remote hosts, and ensure that it is the intended configuration on a particular server that occurs. It is important to have a way to organize our hosts in such an Inventory.

Save below inventory structure in the inventory/dev file to start configuring your development servers. Ensure to replace the IP addresses according to your own setup.

Note: Ansible uses TCP port 22 by default, which means it needs to ssh into target servers from Jenkins-Ansible host – for this you can implement the concept of ssh-agent. Now you need to import your key into ssh-agent:

To learn how to setup SSH agent and connect VS Code to your Jenkins-Ansible instance, please see this video:

For Windows users – [ssh-agent on windows](https://youtu.be/OplGrY74qog)
For Linux users – [ssh-agent on linux](https://youtu.be/OplGrY74qog)

```
eval `ssh-agent -s`
ssh-add <path-to-private-key>
```
Confirm the key has been added with the command below, you should see the name of your key
```
ssh-add -l
```

Now, ssh into your Jenkins-Ansible server using ssh-agent
```
ssh -A ubuntu@public-ip
```
Also notice, that your Load Balancer user is ubuntu and user for RHEL-based servers is ec2-user.

Update your inventory/dev.yml file with this snippet of code

```
[webservers]
<Web-Server1-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
<Web-Server2-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
```

### Step 3 – Create a Common Playbook

It is time to start giving Ansible the instructions on what you needs to be performed on all servers listed in **inventory/dev**.

In common.yml playbook you will write configuration for repeatable, re-usable, and multi-machine tasks that is common to systems within the infrastructure.

Update your **playbooks/common.yml** file with following code:

```
---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      yum:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
    - name: Update apt repo
      apt: 
        update_cache: yes

    - name: ensure wireshark is at the latest version
      apt:
        name: wireshark
        state: latest

```

Examine the code above and try to make sense out of it. This playbook is divided into two parts, each of them is intended to perform the same task: install wireshark utility (or make sure it is updated to the latest version) on your RHEL 8 and Ubuntu servers. It uses root user to perform this task and respective package manager: yum for RHEL 8 and apt for Ubuntu.

### Step 4 – Run Ansible Playbook

```
cd ansible-config-mgt
ansible-playbook -i inventory/dev.yml playbooks/common.yml
```
You can go to each of the servers and check if wireshark has been installed by running which wireshark or wireshark --version


## IMPLEMENTING ANSIBLE REFACTORING AND STATIC ASSIGNMENTS (IMPORTS AND ROLES)

We will continue working with ansible-config-mgt repository and make some improvements of your code. Now you need to refactor your Ansible code, create assignments, and learn how to use the imports functionality. Imports allow to effectively re-use previously created playbooks in a new playbook – it allows you to organize your tasks and reuse them when needed

### Step 1 – Jenkins job enhancement

Before we begin, let us make some changes to our Jenkins job – now every new change in the codes creates a separate directory which is not very convenient when we want to run some commands from one place. Besides, it consumes space on Jenkins serves with each subsequent change. Let us enhance it by introducing a new Jenkins project/job – we will require Copy Artifact plugin.

Go to your Jenkins-Ansible server and create a new directory called ansible-config-artifact – we will store there all artifacts after each build.
sudo mkdir /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact
Change permissions to this directory, so Jenkins could save files there – chmod -R 0777 /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact

Go to Jenkins web console -> Manage Jenkins -> Manage Plugins -> on Available tab search for Copy Artifact and install this plugin without restarting Jenkins

Create a new Freestyle project (you have done it in Project 9) and name it save_artifacts.

This project will be triggered by completion of your existing ansible project. Configure it accordingly:

Note: You can configure number of builds to keep in order to save space on the server, for example, you might want to keep only last 2 or 5 build results. You can also make this change to your ansible job.

The main idea of save_artifacts project is to save artifacts into /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory. To achieve this, create a Build step and choose Copy artifacts from other project, specify ansible as a source project and /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact as a target directory.

Test your set up by making some change in README.MD file inside your ansible-config-mgt repository (right inside master branch).
If both Jenkins jobs have completed one after another – you shall see your files inside /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-artifact directory and it will be updated with every commit to your master branch.

Now your Jenkins pipeline is more neat and clean.

Now your Jenkins pipeline is more neat and clean.

## REFACTOR ANSIBLE CODE BY IMPORTING OTHER PLAYBOOKS INTO SITE.YML

- Within playbooks folder, create a new file and name it site.yml – This file will now be considered as an entry point into the entire infrastructure configuration. Other playbooks will be included here as a reference. In other words, site.yml will become a parent to all other playbooks that will be developed. Including common.yml that you created previously. Dont worry, you will understand more what this means shortly.

- Create a new folder in root of the repository and name it static-assignments. The static-assignments folder is where all other children playbooks will be stored. This is merely for easy organization of your work. It is not an Ansible specific concept, therefore you can choose how you want to organize your work. You will see why the folder name has a prefix of static very soon. For now, just follow along.

- Move common.yml file into the newly created static-assignments folder.

- Inside site.yml file, import common.yml playbook.

```
---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml
```

The code above uses built in [import_playbook](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/collections/ansible/builtin/import_playbook_module.html) Ansible module.

Your folder structure should look like this;
```
├── static-assignments
│   └── common.yml
├── inventory
    └── dev
    └── stage
    └── uat
    └── prod
└── playbooks
    └── site.yml
```
Run ansible-playbook command against the dev environment
Since you need to apply some tasks to your dev servers and wireshark is already installed – you can go ahead and create another playbook under static-assignments and name it common-del.yml. In this playbook, configure deletion of wireshark utility.

```
---
- name: update web, nfs and db servers
  hosts: webservers, nfs, db
  remote_user: ec2-user
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    yum:
      name: wireshark
      state: removed

- name: update LB server
  hosts: lb
  remote_user: ubuntu
  become: yes
  become_user: root
  tasks:
  - name: delete wireshark
    apt:
      name: wireshark-qt
      state: absent
      autoremove: yes
      purge: yes
      autoclean: yes
```
update site.yml with - import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common-del.yml instead of common.yml and run it against dev servers:

```
cd /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/

ansible-playbook -i inventory/dev.yml playbooks/site.yaml
```
Make sure that wireshark is deleted on all the servers by running wireshark --version

Now you have learned how to use import_playbooks module and you have a ready solution to install/delete packages on multiple servers with just one command.

## CONFIGURE UAT WEBSERVERS WITH A ROLE ‘WEBSERVER’
We have our nice and clean dev environment, so let us put it aside and configure 2 new Web Servers as uat. We could write tasks to configure Web Servers in the same playbook, but it would be too messy, instead, we will use a dedicated [role](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html) to make our configuration reusable.

Launch 2 fresh EC2 instances using RHEL 8 image, we will use them as our uat servers, so give them names accordingly – Web1-UAT and Web2-UAT.
Tip: Do not forget to stop EC2 instances that you are not using at the moment to avoid paying extra. For now, you only need 2 new RHEL 8 servers as Web Servers and 1 existing Jenkins-Ansible server up and running.

To create a role, you must create a directory called roles/, relative to the playbook file or in /etc/ansible/ directory.
There are two ways how you can create this folder structure:

Use an Ansible utility called **ansible-galaxy** inside **ansible-config-mgt/roles** directory (you need to create roles directory upfront)

```
mkdir roles
cd roles
ansible-galaxy init webserver
```

Create the directory/files structure manually
Note: You can choose either way, but since you store all your codes in GitHub, it is recommended to create folders and files there rather than locally on Jenkins-Ansible server.

The entire folder structure should look like below, but if you create it manually – you can skip creating tests, files, and vars or remove them if you used ansible-galaxy.

```
└── webserver
    ├── README.md
    ├── defaults
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── files
    ├── handlers
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── meta
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── tasks
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── templates
    ├── tests
    │   ├── inventory
    │   └── test.yml
    └── vars
        └── main.yml
```

After removing unnecessary directories and files, the **roles** structure should look like this

```
└── webserver
    ├── README.md
    ├── defaults
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── handlers
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── meta
    │   └── main.yml
    ├── tasks
    │   └── main.yml
    └── templates
```
Update your inventory ansible-config-mgt/inventory/uat.yml file with IP addresses of your 2 UAT Web servers
NOTE: Ensure you are using ssh-agent to ssh into the Jenkins-Ansible instance 

```
[uat-webservers]
<Web1-UAT-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user' 

<Web2-UAT-Server-Private-IP-Address> ansible_ssh_user='ec2-user'
```
In /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg file uncomment roles_path string and provide a full path to your roles directory roles_path    = /home/ubuntu/ansible-config-mgt/roles, so Ansible could know where to find configured roles.

It is time to start adding some logic to the webserver role. Go into tasks directory, and within the main.yml file, start writing configuration tasks to do the following:

- Install and configure Apache (httpd service)
- Clone Tooling website from GitHub https://github.com/<your-name>/tooling.git.
- Ensure the tooling website code is deployed to /var/www/html on each of 2 UAT Web servers.
- Make sure httpd service is started
- Your main.yml may consist of following tasks:

```
---
- name: install apache
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: "httpd"
    state: present

- name: install git
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.yum:
    name: "git"
    state: present

- name: clone a repo
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.git:
    repo: https://github.com/<your-name>/tooling.git
    dest: /var/www/html
    force: yes

- name: copy html content to one level up
  become: true
  command: cp -r /var/www/html/html/ /var/www/

- name: Start service httpd, if not started
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.service:
    name: httpd
    state: started

- name: recursively remove /var/www/html/html/ directory
  become: true
  ansible.builtin.file:
    path: /var/www/html/html
    state: absent
```

Within the static-assignments folder, create a new assignment for uat-webservers uat-webservers.yml. This is where you will reference the role.

```
---
- hosts: uat-webservers
  roles:
     - webserver
```
Remember that the entry point to our ansible configuration is the site.yml file. Therefore, you need to refer your uat-webservers.yml role inside site.yml.

So, we should have this in site.yml

```
---
- hosts: all
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/common.yml

- hosts: uat-webservers
- import_playbook: ../static-assignments/uat-webservers.yml
```
Now run the playbook against your uat inventory and see what happens:


```
cd ansible-config-mgt
ansible-playbook -i inventory/uat.yml playbooks/site.yml
```
![ansible](/home/goddhi/ansible-config-mgt/ansible.png)

You should be able to see both of your UAT Web servers configured and you can try to reach them from your browser:
