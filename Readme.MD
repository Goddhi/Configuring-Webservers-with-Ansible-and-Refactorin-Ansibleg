## BEGIN ANSIBLE DEVELOPMENT

Create a directory called **ansible-config-mgt**

Within **ansible-config-mgt** directory create a directory and name it **playbooks** – it will be used to store all your playbook files.
Create a directory and name it **inventory** – it will be used to keep your hosts organised.
Within the playbooks folder, create your first playbook, and name it **common.yml**
Within the inventory folder, create an inventory file (.yml) for each environment (Development, Staging Testing and Production) for example : dev.yml, staging.yl, uat.yml, and prod.yml respectively.
